THE GREEK REGIME FLIP MODEL
Greeks-Driven Entry–Exit System for NIFTY Options
1. Model Objective
The Greek Regime Flip Model (GRFM) is designed to generate systematic entry and exit signals for options
trading by identifying which option Greek (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta) is currently dominating P&L; behavior.
Trades are entered only when the dominant Greek aligns with the strategy and exited when dominance flips.
2. Required Inputs
1
Underlying spot price (NIFTY 50)
2
Option price
3
Implied volatility (IV)
4
Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta
5
Time to expiry (in years)
6
Historical IV and Greek distributions (for percentiles)
3. Normalized Greeks
Greeks are normalized to allow comparison across strikes and expiries:
Delta_n = |Delta|
Gamma_n = Gamma × Spot
Vega_n = Vega / max(IV, 0.01)
Theta_n = |Theta| / Option Price
4. Greek Dominance Score (GDS)
Each Greek is assigned a weighted contribution:
GDS_DELTA = 0.45 × Delta_n
GDS_GAMMA = 0.40 × Gamma_n
GDS_VEGA = 0.30 × Vega_n
GDS_THETA = -0.35 × Theta_n
The dominant Greek is the one with the highest GDS value at that timestamp.
5. Market Regime Classification
The overall market regime is determined using dominant Greeks, IV behavior, and spot movement:
If GDS_GAMMA > threshold and IV change is small → GAMMA-DRIVEN
If GDS_VEGA > threshold and IV rising → VEGA-DRIVEN
If GDS_THETA dominates and spot range-bound → THETA-DRIVEN
Else → DELTA-DRIVEN
6. Entry Signals
6.1 Long Gamma / Vega Breakout
Conditions:
 Regime is GAMMA-DRIVEN or VEGA-DRIVEN
 Delta between 0.45 and 0.55
 ATM Gamma percentile > 70
 Theta decay < 1.2% per hour
 IV increasing by at least 1.2%
6.2 Vega Expansion (Calendar / Diagonal)

Conditions:
 Front-month IV lower than back-month IV by at least 2%
 Spot price stable
 Vega dominance score high
6.3 Theta Harvest (Short Premium)
Conditions:
 THETA-DRIVEN regime
 IV percentile above 65
 Absolute Delta below 0.25
 Theta decay exceeds 1.8% per hour
7. Exit Signals (Greek Flip Logic)
Exit Long Options if:
 Gamma drops more than 25% from peak
 IV stops rising for two consecutive bars
 Theta decay exceeds 2% per hour
Exit Short Options if:
 ATM Gamma percentile exceeds 80
 Spot moves more than 60% of implied move
 IV expands by more than 1.5%
8. Position Sizing (Greeks-Based)
Position size is calculated based on Greek risk rather than fixed lots:
Risk per trade = 0.5–0.75% of capital
Long size ∝ Risk / (Theta × 2 + Vega × 1.5)
9. Dashboard & Agent Integration
The model outputs structured signals suitable for agentic systems and dashboards, including:
 Market regime
 Dominant Greek
 Entry/exit signal type
 Strike, expiry, and confidence score
