# Upstox API Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: You need an ACCESS TOKEN (not just API key/secret)
#
# How to get your Upstox Access Token:
# 1. Go to: https://api.upstox.com/
# 2. Login with your Upstox credentials  
# 3. Go to your App
# 4. Click "Generate Token" or use the authorization flow
# 5. Copy the ACCESS TOKEN (it's a long JWT token)
#
# The access token looks like: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
# (It's much longer than the API key)
#
# Paste your ACCESS TOKEN below:
cb681499-48d1-43a4-8a0e-e724d7b9b837
