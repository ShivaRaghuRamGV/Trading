Step1:
Step 1: Compute Greek Pressure Scores (Per Strike)

For each option in the chain (focus ±2% strikes):

Normalize Greeks
Δn = |Delta|
Γn = Gamma / Spot
Vn = Vega / IV
Θn = |Theta| / Premium

Weighted Greek Pressure (GPI)
GPI = 0.4·Δn + 0.3·Γn + 0.2·Vn − 0.1·Θn


Interpretation:

High GPI → movement-sensitive

Low GPI → decay-sensitive
